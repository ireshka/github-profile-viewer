Simple app for viewing profile info based on github username that uses free `Github API`.

I used it as an inspiration for `typescript` + `styled components` exercise.

You can check actual live version [on Netlify](https://view-github-profiles.netlify.app).

## :hammer_and_wrench: Technical details
- create with `create-react-app` setup
- use `eslint`, `prettier`, `husky`, `lint-staged` & `commitlint` for better code quality
- require global installed `netlify-cli` package for deploy
